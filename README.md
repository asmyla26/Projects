This notebook explores tennis questions which aim to identify whether there is a relationship between age and surface on the success of tennis players. Specifically, we explore 3 sub-questions: whether male ATP players in different age brackets experience success at different rates (win percentage %) on the various tour surfaces, how total win counts for female WTP players vary across age brackets, and how doubles players experience success on the different surfaces.  

We used the following datasets in our analysis:
- Kaggle ATP tennis: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ezrielstein/tennis
- Kagge Tennis: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis?resource=download

This project was created by Amitai Smyla, Katie Zhang, and Ishan Sinha!
