This notebook explores Tennis Questions which aim to identify whether there is a relationship between age and surface on the success of tennis players. Specifically, we explore whether players in different age brackets experience success at different rates (win percentage %) on the various tour surfaces, how total win counts vary across age brackets, and how doubles players experience success on the different surfaces.  

This project was created by Amitai Smyla, Katie Zhang, and Ishan Sinha!
